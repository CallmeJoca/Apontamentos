# Interação Humana com Computadores

## Aula 7 - Screen Design

### Basic principles

+ **Ask**:
  + What is the user doing?
+ **Think**:
  + What information is required?
  + Comparisons to make?
  + Order of things?
+ **Design**:
  + **form** follows **funtion**.

### Available ingredients for design

+ Grouping of items;
  + remember: "memory chunking".
+ Order of items;
+ Decoration - fonts, boxes etc.;
+ Alignment of items;
+ White space between items.

### Grouping and structure

+ **logically** together $\implies$ **physically** together

### Order of groups and items

+ Think well about what is the user's natural order, in his mental model;
+ It should match screen order:
  + Use boxes, space, etc;
  + Set up tabbing right.

### Decoration

+ Use boxes to group logical items;
+ Use fonts for emphasis, headings.

### Text Alignment

+ Reading from left to right;
+ In western culture: left hand side text alignment.

### Alignment/Names

+ Whats is easy/convenient/ergonomic for the user.

### Alignment/Numbers

+ Think about convenience:
  + What is the purpose?
  + Which one is bigger?
+ Visually:
  + long numbers are big numbers? No
  + For the sake of truth: align decimal points or right align integers;
  + For the sake of beauty: reduce to the same decimal places(if safe, sacrifice precision).

### Multiple Columns

+ Scanning across gaps hard:
  + often hard to avoid with large data base fields.
+ Use leaders: replaces the conventional ruler.
+ Use different tones/shades.

### Familiar home appliances

+ Grouping of elements
+ Ordering of elements
+ Different decorations
+ Alignments
+ Spacing

### Knowing what to do

+ What is active / What is passive:
  + where do you click
  + where do you type

+ Consistent style helps

+ Labels and icons
  + standards for common actions;
  + language - bold = current state or action.

### Affordances

+ Psychological term for physical objects
  + shape and size suggest actions:
    + pick up, twist, throw.
  + also cultural
    + buttons **afford** pushing.
+ For screen objects
  + button-like object "affords" mouse click
  + physical-like objects suggest use
+ Culture of computer use
  + icons "afford" clicking
  + or even double clicking

A good implementation of natural affordances provides an intuitive interface.

### Web Design

## Aula 8 

### Light, Vision and Colour

+ Light is **essentical** for colour visualization. Without it, nothing would be seen;
+ We only see the light that is **emitted** or **reflected** by the objects and not the objects themselves;
+ Light is an electromagnetic **wave**;
+ The human eye can detect electromagnetic wavelenghts between 400nm and 700nm;

### Colour Theory

Seven General Principles:

+ Harmony
+ Contrast
+ Rhythem
+ REpetition
+ Gradation
+ Balance
+ Dominium

### Design Rules

Designing for maximum usability - the goal of interaction design

+ Principles of usability;
+ Guidelines and Standards;
+ Design patterns.

Design rules:
+ Suggest how to increase usability;
+ Different kinds, containing different levels of generality and authority.

Types of design rules:
+ Principles:
  + **abstract** design rules;
  + **low** authority;
  + **high** generality.
+ Guidelines:
  + claim **more** authority;
  + **less** general / more tech.
+ Standards:
  + **specific** design rules;
  + **high** authority;
  + **limited** application.

### Principles to support usability

+ Learnability:
  + The ease with which new useres can begin effective interaction and achieve maximal performance.
+ Flexibility:
  + The multiplicity of ways the user and system exchange information.
+ Robustness:
  + The level of support provided to the user to ensure successfull achievement and assessment of goal-directed behaviour.

### Principles of Learnability

+ Predicability:
  + determining effect of future actions based on past interaction history;
  + operation visibility.
+ Synthesizability:
  + assessing the effect of past actions;
  + honesty:
    + immediate vs. eventual honesty.
+ Familiarity:
  + how prior knowledge applies to new system;
  + guessability;
  + affordance.
+ Generalizability
  + extending specific interaction knowledge to new situations;
  + across applications.
+ Consistency
  + likeness in input/output behavior arising from similar situations or task objectives;
  + widely mentioned and related to other principles.

### Priciples of Flecibility

+ Dialogue initiative:
  + freedom from system imposed constraints on input dialogue;
  + pre-emptiveness.
+ Multithreading (of a dialog):
  + ability of system to support user interaction for more than one task at a time;
  + concurrent vs. interleaving.
+ Task migratability
  + passing responsibility for task execution between user and system
+ Substitutivity
  + allowing equivalent values of input and output to be substituted for each other
+ Customizability
  + User modifies/parametrizes the system: adaptability;
  + System automatically adjusts itself: adaptivity.
