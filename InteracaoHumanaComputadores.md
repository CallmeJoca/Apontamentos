# Interação Humana com Computadores

## Aula 8 

## Light, Vision and Colour

+ Light is **essentical** for colour visualization. Without it, nothing would be seen;
+ We only see the light that is **emitted** or **reflected** by the objects and not the objects themselves;
+ Light is an electromagnetic **wave**;
+ The human eye can detect electromagnetic wavelenghts between 400nm and 700nm;

## Colour Theory

Seven General Principles:

+ Harmony
+ Contrast
+ Rhythem
+ REpetition
+ Gradation
+ Balance
+ Dominium

## Design Rules

Designing for maximum usability - the goal of interaction design

+ Principles of usability;
+ Guidelines and Standards;
+ Design patterns.

Design rules:
+ Suggest how to increase usability;
+ Different kinds, containing different levels of generality and authority.

Types of design rules:
+ Principles:
  + **abstract** design rules;
  + **low** authority;
  + **high** generality.
+ Guidelines:
  + claim **more** authority;
  + **less** general / more tech.
+ Standards:
  + **specific** design rules;
  + **high** authority;
  + **limited** application.

## Principles to support usability

+ Learnability:
  + The ease with which new useres can begin effective interaction and achieve maximal performance.
+ Flexibility:
  + The multiplicity of ways the user and system exchange information.
+ Robustness:
  + The level of support provided to the user to ensure successfull achievement and assessment of goal-directed behaviour.

## Principles of Learnability

+ Predicability:
  + determining effect of future actions based on past interaction history;
  + operation visibility.
+ Synthesizability:
  + assessing the effect of past actions;
  + honesty:
    + immediate vs. eventual honesty.
+ Familiarity:
  + how prior knowledge applies to new system;
  + guessability;
  + affordance.
+ Generalizability
  + extending specific interaction knowledge to new situations;
  + across applications.
+ Consistency
  + likeness in input/output behavior arising from similar situations or task objectives;
  + widely mentioned and related to other principles.

## Priciples of Flecibility

+ Dialogue initiative:
  + freedom from system imposed constraints on input dialogue;
  + pre-emptiveness.
+ Multithreading (of a dialog):
  + ability of system to support user interaction for more than one task at a time;
  + concurrent vs. interleaving.
+ Task migratability
  + passing responsibility for task execution between user and system
+ Substitutivity
  + allowing equivalent values of input and output to be substituted for each other
+ Customizability
  + User modifies/parametrizes the system: adaptability;
  + System automatically adjusts itself: adaptivity.
